        1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </li>

      <p>
        The first thing I paid attention to when I I first entered the website
        is the dynamic video playing a person and large amount of texts on the
        corners of the screen.
      </p>

      <li>
        2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </li>

      <p>
        The first action I did on the website is pressed the plus icon on the
        right bottom corner, and then tap IG. This action brings me from the
        website to their Instagram page. Action 2 is tapped the huge B button on
        the left bottom corner, the texts has an animation that expands the full
        name of the creator, and a layer UI flow on the texts presenting Rich
        Brownâ€™s Q&A information. Action 3 I scrolled down to the bottom of the
        website, it started to showing animation of decreasing the image depth
        and showing a list of the winners of the European design awards.
      </p>

      <li>
        3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </li>

      <p>
        The part that I spend most of my time interacting with on this website
        is the swapping section part, which when the user does a scroll action
        the website present a transition from one section to another. The
        animation is very smooth and at the same time present the content
        clearly. In addition, besides the scrolling part I also spent some time
        on the color changing button, it is interesting and gives user a fun
        interactive experience, providing a different colors of the background
        can effect the users mood and impression on the website.
      </p>

      <li>
        4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </li>

      <p>
        The most common action I did while I browse this website is the scroll
        down action. The website automatically shows animation to others
        information when the user does a scroll down animation. For instance,
        even the user wants to browse the information on the right side of the
        page (In the information sections), doing a scroll down action the
        website will presents the sections swapping to right. Overall, the main
        action I did in this website is scrolling down and the R return button
        to home.
      </p>

      <li>
        5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </li>

      <p>
        The ultimate goal of this website is to let the user browse all this art
        related information in a modern interface style with fancy animations.
        At first when I entered the website, I had a great impression because
        the dynamic video with texts on it just brings a strong visual impact to
        the users, the positions of the texts sets the tone for the website
        itself to the user, which is a strong artistic style website. Scroll
        down to website and that is where the core interaction begins. The
        highlight of the website present perfectly while doing a smooth
        animation transit to another section, and the color change button makes
        the website speak for itself, it is a website that is different from
        others. Overall, my impression on this website is great especially on
        the interaction and visual designs.
      </p>

      <li>
        6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </li>

      <p>
        The primary goal of this website is delivering the information to the
        users with the additional website interaction to enhance the browsing
        experience. In my opinion, they achieved this goal in a very high
        standard. In the visual aspect, the placement of the texts positioned
        well which makes the user easy to read the information on it, this
        achieves the goal of communicating with the user and delivered the
        information. In addition, they did a fantastic job on the animation
        transition which feels smooth and refreshing while browsing it, which
        achieved another main primary goal to let user having a great impression
        and smooth browsing experience.
      </p>

      <li>
        7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </li>

      <p>
        Overall, I think the website is generally designed for both long term
        and short term engagement, depends on different types of users. For
        example, long term user for this website maybe someone who is interested
        into the art information provided in the website, or someone who is
        attracted to the interaction. Because of these reasons there are
        potential possibilities for them to visit the website for multiple
        times. On the other hand, the website is also short terms for sets of
        users. For those who only want to browse the information for a quick
        glance, they will not pay too much attention to the information and the
        interactions. In general, this website can be interacted by different
        types of the user overtime depending on their purposes & interests.
      </p>

      <li>
        8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </li>

      <p>
        For the website I did find some features and mechanisms that the
        designers are trying to encourage the users to return and browse
        overtime. The section scrolling part contain many works from the
        designers, and when used clicked the each section it expands the page to
        a texts or art work images. The little designing detail used perfectly
        here because the designers is trying to make many contents hidden in the
        large section so it allows user to stay browsing longer on the website,
        which is a feature that encourages users to return one day if they try
        to have a look at other artworks in the website.
      </p>

      <li>
        9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </li>

      <p>
        In my opinion, the interactive experience of this website is referenced
        to the experience of walking through an exhibition. When I browse
        through the website, it brings me through from up to the bottom with
        some fancy animations and interaction which reminds me of my past
        experience when walking through an art exhibition. The interactive
        animation/transition is the switch that activate the interaction
        experience, which many of the modern art exhibition requires. I would
        say the website experience is strongly inspired by the process of
        walking through an art gallery.
      </p>

      <li>
        10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </li>

      <p>
        The references definitely affects the way of how I should browse the
        website correctly. As a mentioned in the last question I assume the
        website is taken inspiration from the process of walking through an art
        gallery, therefore it is a linear process that only requires me to
        scroll down to view more information about the website. Linear process
        or browsing experience provide users an easier to access to the website,
        which does not require them to do complex gestures to browse more. In
        general, during a while of browsing on the website, I found out the
        website majority of movement is linear up and down scrolling, therefore
        when I engaging with the website will only doing scrolling up or down to
        view more information.
      </p>

      <li>
        11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </li>

      <p>
        The reference of inspiriting by a form of art gallery walkthrough effect
        the way of me browsing the website. I will focus more on the interaction
        of the website while scrolling. I am very curious and interested to
        discover more smooth animation design from these designers, animation
        transitions and website interactive defines the level of user
        experience. Therefore, if a website has a lots of interaction and
        animation, personally I will pay more attention to them because I focus
        more on the user experience than the content quality.
      </p>

      <li>
        12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </li>

      <p>
        The most frustrating part of the interaction while I am browsing the
        website is the white T icons located on the left and the right screen.
        In my opinion, their presence is more for aesthetics than for practical
        purposes. While I clicked the right button it actually as an enter key
        which brings to the next page, and the most frustrating part is that I
        pressed the left T button, it does not have any interaction even though
        I wish it was a return key to brings me back to the previous page. It is
        a little disappointing experience in these button and I assume that the
        designer is pursuing the simplistic style too extreme here.
      </p>

      <li>
        13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </li>

      <p>
        The most satisfying part of the interaction of this website is the
        scroll to right in the sections and changes the color button. In the
        section part, if I do a down scroll the texts will smoothly goes left,
        it is a very simple animation but it feels so satisfying while browsing
        because these little extra details enhances the whole browsing
        experience. Another highlight of this website to me which I also find
        satisfying while using is the T button on the right side of the screen.
        It act as an enter key in the website and if I press it in the section
        part, the color of the theme changes and it brings me to the detail
        page. It is a very surprising feature to me because it is hardly find
        these interesting animations in the modern day website. When I discover
        this feature I feel so satisfying to use.
