                         <A3 WRITTEN REFLECTION>



In assignment 3, I was inspired by the idea of a slider to present information 
or video. Therefore I decided created my own video slider to showcase some of 
the highlighted videos in our life.


My idea of the project is to create a video slider that allow user to rewind 
their memorable videos they took in their past. These videos are entertaining 
to watch and can create an emotional feelings to the user, however, sometimes 
user just forgot about these videos and leave it in the photo album and never 
watch it again. My video slider will be a platform to organize these forgotten 
memories and combined them into a video slider, so that they can rewind them on 
their device at anytime, at anywhere. Therefore the slider I created is called 
“Memory Capsule”. I named it and put it onto the title because it is meaningful, 
it fits the idea of the containing memory in one compact video player. In this 
project I will be showing five videos that I chose that I think that represent 
my favorite memories in the past year. User can browser through these videos 
to review the journey of my life.


In terms of the interface style of my video slider, I used a classic video player 
style interface which is a huge screen display space in the middle. It is clear 
to highlight the important information in this style and it creates a strong 
visual impact because it is center positioned. The color style I choose is a 
blue tone color, at the background of the video player I used a gradient dark 
blue tone color light blue, toned the color in the style.css tab to gets the 
best choice of blue. The reason for this is because the dark blue creates a 
deep and cinematic feeling, it contrast really well with the video and makes 
user feels immersive while watching it. In order to make it color unified, I 
changed color of the “memory capsule” title text into a light blue tone color 
fits the overall color style, changing the color in style.css and positioned 
it in the middle. 


In the navigational aspect of this video player, I spent some time developing 
the best browsing experience while transitioning the videos. First of all the 
inserting the videos, I compressed all five videos and add the them into html 
video wrapper in order. Coded the left and right swipe button so user can 
decide which video they want to watch. About the interaction, I made the each 
transitions between the video an ease in-out effect, so the transition won’t 
be sudden and will have a fade animation. Video player has been functioned 
fully with the classic play - pause buttons, sound adjustments, full screen 
and setting. Options of adjusting for users is widely provided to ensure the 
best viewing experience during the video playing.



Overall, these are the core ideas and features of how my memory capsule project 
is designed. Using interactive video slider to help users to rewind their 
memorable moments highlighted in their life journey.
