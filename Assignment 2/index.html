  <p>
    The pink wave effects looks great on the screen and it provides a 3D effect.
  </p>

  <p>
    The music of the video is abstract and it kind of fits of the style of the video, the beats of the music greatly matches with the video. I like it!
  </p>

  <p>
    First of all, the flow of the video is well contrlled, the pace is balance and I think it is a great ambient video to watch before going to bed!
  </p>

  <p>
    The second half of the video reminds me of the movie Spiderman, the effects look like a spiderweb flowing thorugh the screen and it pushes the video atmosphere to the next level.

    <A2 WRITTEN REFLECTION>


The initial idea of my website is inspired by the YouTube video player interface 
and function. My ultimate goal is to brings user a smooth experience of viewing 
the video.

In the visual aspect, I use light purple as the main background color. Considering 
the whole website is an exclusive experience just to showcase this specific video, 
therefore I used a matching purple to contrast with light pink of the video tone, 
changed the color in background color in style.css. As well as the title 
“Assignment 2” using the light pink to match the color tone. 

Deep diving in to the function aspect of my website. I added four buttons to allow 
user to repeat, play, pause and make video full screen. In the code, I adjust the 
width and the height of the buttons and make them align center so they can position 
in the middle of the screen to provide the most balanced visual experience. Used 
function and add event listeners to control the command of the buttons. Moreover, 
placing the image png on each button to showcase the icon of the buttons, provide 
a clear navigation to the users. I also enlarged the size of the video to make them 
occupied most of the screen’s space, did some tuning in the margin top & bottom to 
make it placed in my ideal position. And align centered the title to make it look 
visually balance.

If you scroll down it will show a comment section, showing few comments of other 
user’s after viewing this video. This comment part was inspired by the YouTube, 
while I was making it, I felt like it is more realistic and makes the whole 
experience more complete for the user if I add a comment section to enhance the 
interaction, make it more than just a video player but a user interactive space. 
The title of the comment section texts has specially change to pink. Between each 
comments I used dashed border - bottom in style.css. The border separates the 
task and brings spaces between each comments. 

Overall, these are my reflection and summary of the process while coding this 
website.
