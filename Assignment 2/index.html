  <p>
    The pink wave effects looks great on the screen and it provides a 3D effect.
  </p>

  <p>
    The music of the video is abstract and it kind of fits of the style of the video, the beats of the music greatly matches with the video. I like it!
  </p>

  <p>
    First of all, the flow of the video is well contrlled, the pace is balance and I think it is a great ambient video to watch before going to bed!
  </p>

  <p>
    The second half of the video reminds me of the movie Spiderman, the effects look like a spiderweb flowing thorugh the screen and it pushes the video atmosphere to the next level.
